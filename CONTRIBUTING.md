# 🚀 Getting Started

## 1. Fork the Repository

Click the **Fork** button at the top-right corner of the repository page.

Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/neurovision.git
cd neurovision
```

---

## 2. Create a New Branch

Please avoid working directly on the `main` branch.

Create a separate branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Example branch names:

```bash
feature/improve-segmentation
fix/model-loading-error
docs/update-readme
```

---

## 3. Set Up the Environment

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

### Windows
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Linux/macOS
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
